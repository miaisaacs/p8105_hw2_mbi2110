# problem 1 - NYC transit data

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable.

```{r}
nyc_df = 
  read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", 1, 0))

view(nyc_df)
```
