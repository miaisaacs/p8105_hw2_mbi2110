# problem 1 - NYC transit data

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable.

``` r
nyc_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

view(nyc_df)
```

Write a short paragraph about this dataset – explain briefly what
variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so
far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset.
Are these data tidy?

``` r
nrow(nyc_df)
```

    ## [1] 1868

``` r
ncol(nyc_df)
```

    ## [1] 20

``` r
colnames(nyc_df)
```

    ##  [1] "line"              "station_name"      "station_latitude" 
    ##  [4] "station_longitude" "route1"            "route2"           
    ##  [7] "route3"            "route4"            "route5"           
    ## [10] "route6"            "route7"            "route8"           
    ## [13] "route9"            "route10"           "route11"          
    ## [16] "entry"             "exit_only"         "vending"          
    ## [19] "entrance_type"     "ada"

This dataset contains 19 columns and 1868 rows, consisting of the
variables line, name, latitude, longitude, routes 1-11, entrance type,
entry, vending, and ada compliance. To clean my data, I used the
clean_names step to make the variable naming convention consistent and I
selected for the variables of interest. I used a mutate step to change
the entry variable from yes/no to a logical variable and specified that
routes 8-11 should also be character. These data are not tidy because
route and route number should be variables, which means we would have to
convert them from wide to long format.

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
nyc_df |> 
  select(station_name, line) |> 
  distinct()
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # ℹ 455 more rows

There are 465 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
nyc_df |> 
  filter(ada == TRUE) |> 
  select(station_name, line) |> 
  distinct()
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # ℹ 74 more rows

Only 84 stations are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
nyc_df |> 
  filter(vending == "NO") |> 
  pull(entry) |> 
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance
is 0.3770492.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations
that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
nyc_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") |> 
  filter(route == "A") |> 
  select(station_name, line) |> 
  distinct()
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    station_name                  line           
    ##    <chr>                         <chr>

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of that stations that serve the
A train, only 17 are ADA compliant.

# problem 2 - mr. trash wheel data

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:specify the sheet in the Excel
file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns
containing notes) using arguments in read_excel, use reasonable variable
names, omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data, round the
number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to
an integer variable (using as.integer)

``` r
mr_trash_df =
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             na = c("NA", ".", ""),
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N653") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    weight = weight_tons, 
    volume = volume_cubic_yards) |> 
  select(-homes_powered) |> 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(
    round(sports_balls)),
    trash_type = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    year = as.integer(year)
    ) 
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine this with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to both
datasets before combining.

``` r
prof_trash_df =
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             na = c("NA", ".", ""),
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M120") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    weight = weight_tons, 
    volume = volume_cubic_yards) |> 
  select(-homes_powered) |> 
  mutate(trash_type = "Prof. Trash Wheel",
         year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
gwynnda_df =
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             na = c("NA", ".", ""),
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L265") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
    rename(
    weight = weight_tons, 
    volume = volume_cubic_yards) |> 
  select(-homes_powered) |> 
  mutate(trash_type = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
         year = as.integer(year))
```

``` r
all_trash_df =
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwynnda_df)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022?

The all_trash_df consists of data from three separate Trash Wheels:
Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. There
are 1032 total observations and the variables include dumpster, month,
year, date, weight, volume, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
trash_type.

``` r
all_trash_df |> 
  filter(trash_type == "Prof. Trash Wheel") |> 
  summarise(sum(weight))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   `sum(weight)`
    ##           <dbl>
    ## 1          247.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 247
tons.

``` r
all_trash_df |> 
  filter(trash_type == "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
         month == "June",
         year == 2022) |> 
  summarise(sum(cigarette_butts))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   `sum(cigarette_butts)`
    ##                    <dbl>
    ## 1                  18120

In June of 2022, Gwynnda collected a total of 18,120 cigarette butts.

# problem 3 - great british bake off

In the first part of this problem, your goal is to create a single,
well-organized dataset with all the information contained in these data
files. To that end: import, clean, tidy, and otherwise wrangle each of
these datasets; check for completeness and correctness across datasets
(e.g. by viewing individual datasets and using anti_join); merge to
create a single, final dataset; and organize this so that variables and
observations are in meaningful orders. Export the result as a CSV in the
directory containing the original datasets.

  read_csv("data/bakers.csv") |>
